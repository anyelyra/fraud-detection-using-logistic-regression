# Fraud Detection Model in Banking Transactions Using Logistic Regression
[Group Project for the Final Exam in Data Science Class]
Conducting fraud detection on synthetic banking data using a Logistic Regression model and the SMOTE method to handle imbalanced data.

## Data
The data for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's PaySim dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1), which simulates mobile money transactions for the purpose of fraud detection research.

## Modelling process
1. Import the data
2. Data preparation (e.g., detecting missing values, duplicates, encoding, etc.)
3. Data exploration
4. Logistic Regression model development using the scikit-learn module
5. Applying SMOTE to balance the dataset
6. Model accuracy analysis (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
